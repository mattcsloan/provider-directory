# provider-directory

UI coding challenge, built with React.<br>

## Instructions

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm test -- --coverage`

To include a coverage report, Jest has an integrated coverage reporter that works well with ES6 and requires no configuration.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
